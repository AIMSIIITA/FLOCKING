# **Couzin Model Swarm Simulation**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Couzin Model for simulating and visualizing swarm behavior. The Couzin Model is a well-known framework used to study collective motion in biological systems, such as schools of fish, flocks of birds, and herds of animals. The implementation visualizes how agents interact within a swarm based on local rules of repulsion, alignment, and attraction.

### **Features**

- Swarm Simulation: Simulate a group of agents (robots, animals, etc.) interacting based on the Couzin Model.
- Visualization: Real-time animation of the swarm behavior using Matplotlib's quiver plot.
- Modular Design: Easy-to-understand code structure with separate classes for the agent, swarm, and simulation.
- Configurable Parameters: Adjust parameters like the number of agents, speed, interaction radii, and noise to explore different swarm dynamics.

#### **Dependencies**
- ```'numpy'```
- ```'matplotlib'```

#### **Usage**
1. ##### **Run the simulation:**
   ``` python3 couzin_main.py```
2. ##### **Adjust parameters:**
   You can modify the parameters in the Simulation class within simulation.py to explore different behaviors. Key parameters include:
   - *'num_agent'*: Number of agents in the swarm.
   - *'speed'*: Speed of each agent.
   - *'space_size'*: Size of the 2D simulation space.
   - *'sigma'*: Standard deviation of the noise applied to agent movement.
   - *'rep_r'*: Repulsion radius.
   - *'orien_r'*: Orientation radius.
   - *'attr_r'*: Attraction radius.
   - *'dt'*: Time step for the simulation.
### **References**
This implementation is based on the Couzin Model, a widely recognized framework in the study of collective animal behavior. For more information, you can refer to the original paper:
- Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., Franks, N.R., & Levin, S.A. (2005). Effective leadership and decision-making in animal groups on the move. Nature.

This implementation serves as a basic starting point for understanding swarm dynamics and collective behavior. By modifying and extending the code, you can explore various aspects of agent-based modeling and swarm intelligence.

Happy coding!
